        Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
        Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
        Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
        But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
        likeness of men:
        And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
        death of the cross.
        Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
        That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and
        things under the earth;
        And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
        Father. Philippians 2:4-11
    </p>
    <p>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:11</p>

        NOTE: This does not lift the emergency order under the Quarantine Act that the Government of Canada has put
        in place. It applies to all travellers. Upon arrival in Canada, by air or by land, you must quarantine
        (self-isolate) for 14 days. This is mandatory. We ask that you respect this requirement, if you have
        travelled out of the country or are experiencing any symptoms (fever, coughing and difficulty breathing) we
        invite you to join us for our Live Online Stream.
